<h1>Session 1: The Silent Hoofprints</h1>
<h2>April 9th, 2025</h2>
<h2>Session Overview</h2>
<p>Date: March 25, 2965 TA<br>
  Locations: Bree and a nearby bopse of trees</p>
<h2>Major Events & Turning Points</h2>
<p>1. The heroes spoke with the bribed north man, but he was not bribed but threatened to stay quite. He was persuaded to talk with Flam. He reveals that one of the men may have resembled one of the men of the south
2. Studs and flam also spoke with the dwarves. Studs confronted them with the pouch of silver. A fight almost broke out, but Studs was able to calm things down and flam was even able to talk them into a little business, and bought an axe head
3. Dimirror and Goewen investigate the stable. Goewen talks with Barley and persuades him to tell her about the blacksmith apprentice- that he’s had more money the past 2 days and has been spending freely at the pony.
The company travels down the greenway where they spy the thieves in a grove of trees- the two men of the south and the apprentice. Goewen hid outside the grove with her bow ready while the rest of the fellowship confronted them. Studs was so persuasive, that he got them to tell the fellowship their story. Baran and Kadran were soldiers in Rohan. Baran was a captain. He had saved Kadran’s life in a battle once, so Kadran is fiercely loyal. Baran was injured, leading to his limp and burned face. His fiancé left him due to his scars, which drove him to despair. He left Rohan and he and Kadran had been living as outlaws ever since. They were hoping this job stealing the horse would net them enough money to stop thieving and go straight again.
The fellowship takes them back to Bree, where they argue for mercy before the magistrate. He agrees, and they are sentenced to a work/rehabilitation program where they work during the day and spend the night in the cells. This is probationary and will depend on how their behavior. The apprentice ran off and later slunk back into town. He is currently in prison. Only his brother is mad about this and everyone else thinks it’s well deserved.
